# On the Division of a String

On the Division of a String is a six-channel installation-performance for monochord, computer and loudspeakers. It is part of an ongoing project that investigates issues in medieval music theory. Historically, the monochord's purpose was didactic. It was used mainly as a way of demonstrating intervallic relationships in musical sound, though there is some evidence that it was used as a performing instrument and, also, for pitch production in vocal pedagogy. In this new installation-performance, the material properties of a string are taken as the basis for computer sound synthesis and the intervallic relationships used to create an algorithmic composition.

Following principles outlined in medieval treatises, four, consecutive notes of a musical scale (tetrachord) are established. This is achieved by first dividing the string into eight parts and adding a ninth (thus producing the ratio 9:8 or sesquioctava) and second by dividing the eight-part division into three parts and adding a third. This system produces two whole tones (9:8) and a Pythagorean semitone (256:243). Next, a sound is sculpted according to an analysis of the harmonic partials of the vibrating string. Finally, the two ratios are used to determine the computational operations performed upon the synthetic sound. The computer audio is therefore 'tuned' by an instrument designed for demonstrating the sonic properties of physical materials.
