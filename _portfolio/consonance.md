_**On the Production of True Consonance**_ (2016) is an 8-channel sound installation for automated monochord, loudspeakers and MaxMSP. Six tiny loudspeakers are suspended in a hexagonal formation above an elm wood monochord.

The work is based on a letter from the sixteenth-century mathematician, Giovanni Battista Benedetti to the composer, Cipriano de Rore, in which Benedetti demonstrates a phenomenon of pitch drift in choral singing.
