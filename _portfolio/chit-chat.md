# Chit-chat

_**Chit-chat**_ (2017) is an interactive sound installation that transforms a human vocalization into birdsong. When a participant speaks or sings into a microphone, their voice is transformed into a bird-call.

The sound of the bird-call is determined by the musical characteristics (pitch variation, loudness) of whatever the participant says or sings into the mic. This bird-call triggers further calls from the other bird-boxes, which are also shaped by the original vocalization. The result is a musical ‘conversation’ with a flock of ‘birds’. The installation was built with [Max7](http://www.cycling74.com) software, with additional use of IRCAM's [FTM & Co](http://ftm.ircam.fr/index.php/Main_Page) library:
