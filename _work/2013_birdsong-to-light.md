The exhibition comprised three sound installations, which were arranged according to the church's cruciform design. Each installation explored medieval ideas about music, particularly, the relationship between music, science and architecture.  Each section - nave, transept, chancel - is used a metaphor for one of the three kinds of music in the Middle Ages, from the 'lowest' form of music-making (musica instrumentalis) to the 'highest' (musica mundana).

The nave contained a new version of *An Audience with the Trees* (2005), created especially for the exhibition. Four handmade bird boxes were attached to four trees, which defined a pathway through the nave. Each bird box contained a small loudspeaker and broadcasted the sound of a bird singing the melodic lines of the medieval song, 'Sumer is Icumen In', in canon with the other ‘birds’ in the other bird boxes.

The transept contained a new work, *Medicatio* (2013), which was divided into two parts. In the south transept, there was an automated monochord, a display cabinet containing a collection of spectrogram readings of vocal samples and an accompanying audio work, *Chant* (2013). In the north transept, visitors were able to interact with a live audio feed of the monochord from the south transept by intoning a pitch into a microphone

<br>The final work in the exhibition was a multichannel sound/video installation titled *On the Operations of the Sun* situated in the chancel. The work takes the structure of a medieval rose window to give musical form to the sounds of a twelve-part choir. The title comes from De Operationibus Solis by Robert Grosseteste, a medieval philosopher who wrote extensively about light.

A digital animation of the South Rose Window at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris was projected at the far end of a bespoke screening room in the Chancel. Gradually, the animation grew from the centre to the circumference of the rose, synchronized with the sounds of the voices. The slow rate at which the rose was revealed allowed visitors a greatly ‘expanded’ sense of time. Indeed, this ‘highest’ section of the exhibition set medieval notions of a transcendent ‘music’ of the universe against the pace and ephemerality of our daily lives.
