# Chit-chat 

_**Chit-chat**_ (2017) is an interactive sound installation that transforms a human vocalization into birdsong. When a participant speaks or sings into a microphone, their voice is transformed into a bird-call.

<br><br>
The sound of the bird-call is determined by the musical characteristics (pitch variation, loudness) of whatever the participant says or sings into the mic. This bird-call triggers further calls from the other bird-boxes, which are also shaped by the original vocalization. The result is a musical ‘conversation’ with a flock of ‘birds’.
