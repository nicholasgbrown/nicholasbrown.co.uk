The installation was originally designed for the woodland environment of Addison’s Walk in the grounds of Magdalen College, Oxford. It was first installed on May Morning, 2005 to coincide with the dawn singing of Magalen College Choir atop Magdalen's Great Tower, overlooking Magdalen Bridge.  

Six bird boxes were attached in pairs to three trees along the Walk, near to a tree trunk that was once cut into the shape of a chair. Earlier in the year, recordings of different birdcalls were collected in the vicinity of Magdalen College and manipulated using computer sampling software. Each bird box contained a loudspeaker and broadcasted a complete ‘birdsong’, which was in fact a computer-constructed ‘performance’ of one of the six instrumental parts of *Vivaldi’s Menagerie*, Nicholas Brown's concerto for violin and strings, composed in 2003 for the Orchestra of St John's using melodies from Vivaldi’s *Four Seasons*.

*An Audience with the Trees* attempts to ‘reverse’ a process of representation that underwrites live performances of Vivaldi’s famous concertos. Instead of string players imitating birdsong in order to create a musical performance, visitors walking past the bird boxes on the trees hear ‘birds’ realizing the melodic parts of an existing piece of music for string orchestra (*Vivaldi’s Menagerie*). The perceptual game is one of sorting environmental noise (e.g. natural birdsong) from electronically manipulated ‘birdsong’, which aspires to a performance of a musical work. 

*An Audience with the Trees* was subsequently installed in the courtyard of Said Business School, Oxford in 2007, part of an event hosted by Oxford Contemporary Music.
