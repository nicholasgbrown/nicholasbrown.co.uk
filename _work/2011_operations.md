# On the Operations of the Sun

_**On the Operations of the Sun**_ (2011) addresses the relationship between science, music and architecture in the context of medieval thought. The title comes from **De Operationibus Solis** by Robert Grosseteste, a medieval philosopher who wrote about light as the 'first form' of all things.

The musical structure of the piece derives from the geometry of the South Rose Window at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. The composition process began with the creation of a computer animation designed to show the twelve petals of the window’s stone tracery growing outwards from the centre to the circumference. The animation was made using the computer programme, **Processing**.

Cartesian co-ordinates were recorded for each point as it inscribed a petal on the computer screen. These co-ordinates were treated as frequency ranges, converted to musical pitches and used in the process of composing the vocal lines. Therefore, the music sung by each of the twelve singers represents the development of one of the twelve rose petals. The composition is intended to be performed alongside a synchronized video projection of the digital animation.

**On the Operations of the Sun** was written for Musica Beata. It was first performed by the choir, conducted by Tom Hammond-Davies, at the Three Choirs Festival, Worcester, in 2011, synchronized with the animation.

The work was subsequently presented as a twelve-channel sound/video installation in the context of N.G. Brown’s solo exhibition, ‘From Birdsong to Light’ at Hungate Medieval Art, Norwich, in 2013. More info [here](https://www.nicholasbrown.co.uk/work/2013_birdsong-to-light.html).
