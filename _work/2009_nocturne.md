# Nocturne

_**Nocturne**_ (2009) is a micro-performance piece for pianist and lighting operator with house PA system. It explores an issue in the philosophy of music through the music of Frédéric Chopin, namely the relationship between what is written down, 'in' a musical score and the nature of a musical performance. In particular, the work explores the necessity of light for a 'score-based' understanding of music.
