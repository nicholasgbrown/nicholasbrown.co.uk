# A Toy for Tony

*A Toy for Tony* is a setting of a poem by Seamus Heaney, written to mark the retirement of Anthony Smith CBE, President of Magdalen College, Oxford 1988-2005. The composition sets three verses from the Hymnus Eucharisticus of Magdalen College, making a frame around Heaney’s poem.

The setting is scored for counter-tenor and piano. The music begins by reworking Benjamin Rogers’s 1685 setting of the Hymn, before moving to an imitation of the bells of Magdalen Tower. The piece was first performed by Robin Blaze (countertenor) and Nicholas Brown (piano) at Wigmore Hall, London in 2005.
