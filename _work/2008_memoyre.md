# As I Have Now Memoyre

**As I Have Now Memoyre** (2008) is a large-scale electroacoustic vocal work about the relationship between singing and and the passing of time. It was first performed in 2009 by vocalists, Linda Hirst and Natasha Lohan, during a sell-out event of musical performance art, The Meaning Between Us, at Kings Place, London, produced by Sound & Music.

The two singers inhabit an installation that is assembled during the course of the show. The audience is invited to wander amongst the performers and witness their actions as they decode musical notation with mirrors, write on polythene walls and, at one point, build a chamber for a quartet of birds that sings eighteenth-century music.

**SYNOPSIS**

In Part One, a singing teacher gives a lesson to her pupil, based on a seventeenth-century treatise on the art of song. During the lesson, the pupil's ambition and confidence increase. Eventually, she challenges her teacher by singing back at her a highly compressed, melodic parody of everything she has been taught. The teacher leaves the studio and the pupil sits at her desk.

In Part Two, the pupil paints a visual impression of the teacher's voice onto a polythene wall by copying a pattern that the teacher made with grains of salt during Part One.

In Part Three, the pupil gives a solo performance of Shakespeare's 102nd sonnet before the teacher returns to the studio. Teacher and pupil sit either side of the polythene wall with the painted image of the teacher’s voice and sing a duet. The pupil sings a text by the Roman philosopher, Seneca on the difference between remembering and knowing. The teacher utters short, guttural fragments in an attempt to emulate the soaring melodic lines of her pupil. Eventually, the duet reaches an impasse and the pupil makes her exit. The teacher leaves her studio and, in an attempt to reclaim her youth, sits on the pupil’s stool and sings a fragmented version of the song the pupil sang in Part Two: ‘Just as the white swan sings at the time of his death, so to you I make my lament’.

<br>The first installation-performance of *As I Have Now Memoyre* took place at Kings Place, London as part of Mimomaniac's sell-out debut show, 'The Meaning Between Us', for Sound & Music's series of monthly experimental music nights, 'The Sound Source'. Since that original production, the work has toured to Riverside Studios, London (Tête à Tête opera festival, Aug 09), University of East Anglia (Sonic Arts series, No. 58, March 2010) and the Louise Blouin Foundation, London (April, 2010).

In 2012, Nicholas Brown produced and directed a film of the work, with cinematography by Tom Maine.
