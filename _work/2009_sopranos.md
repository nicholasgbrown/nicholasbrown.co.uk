Chladni figures show modes of vibration on a rigid surface. The work is an extemporization on a section of Nicholas Brown's installation-performance, **As I Have Memoyre**, in which a singer's voice is inscribed on a perspex plate in the form of a chladni pattern. The piece was therefore conceived for performance in the same context as **As I Have Memoyre**.

**Battling Sopranos** was first performed in Februrary 2009 at Kings Place, London as part of Mimomaniac’s sell-out debut show, ‘The Meaning Between Us’, for Sound & Music’s series of monthly experimental music nights, ‘The Sound Source’.
