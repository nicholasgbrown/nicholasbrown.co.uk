# The Soul Finds Rest in Unity

_**The Soul Finds Rest in Unity**_ (2007) is an installation for a domestic environment that comprises visual documents, drawings, objects, sound, video and private violin performances. It theatricalizes the process of learning a new work of music by examining the implications for the human body and the violin as its prosthesis.

_**The Soul Finds Rest in Unity**_ was first installed in a suite at The George Hotel, Huddersfield and formed the temporary home of violinist, Monica Germino (US/NL) whilst in residence at the 2007 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.
