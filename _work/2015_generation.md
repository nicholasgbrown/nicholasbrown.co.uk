# On the Generation of Sounds

_**On the Generation of Sounds**_ (2015) is a lecture-performance in which biofeedback audio-control meets medieval physics of sound and motion. It was first presented at the [Cambridge Festival of Ideas](https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk), UK in October 2015.

The project investigates Robert Grosseteste’s thirteenth-century treatise on sound and phonetics, *De Generatione Sonorum* in a context of live electro-acoustic musical performance. The sounds of the human voice are modulated by motion-sensing technologies in response to Grosseteste’s ideas, such as the relationship between the formation of vowels and different types of physical motion.

The project is the second installment in Nicholas Brown’s ongoing Grosseteste Project, following his 2011 choral installation-performance, *On the Operations of the Sun*

Here is a video of the first movement, titled, *Consonare*:
