Lacey Brown Roth at Project Arts Dublin
	
I'll be playing (monochord/electronics) at Project Arts Centre this Saturday (6 July) with David Lacey (percussion) and Nick Roth (saxophone). Our trio will feature in the inaugural <a href="http://soundcollector.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sound Collector</a> event. Sound Collector is a series of events in Dublin which explore the spaces between music, installation, improvisation, sound, and noise.

I've recently revised my monochord rig so that it is built around Pure Data running on a Beaglebone Black with a <a href="http://bela.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bela</a> cape. I'm very excited about the possibilities of Bela, with its super low latency. I think it makes playing an electronically mediated instrument much more like playing an acoustic instrument: the reduction in latency values really does make a difference.
